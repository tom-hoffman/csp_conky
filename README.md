CSP Conky
=========

This is a Conky configuration with the specific goal of displaying system information to be projected in front of an introductory computer science class, specifically AP Computer Science Principles.

It will be different than most Conky configurations because it will have a lot of explanatory text and English language explanations.

For example: `<this computer>'s CPU cores are running at 3.15 billion ticks per second.`
